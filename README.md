Introduction
------------

My Todo List is a practical application aimed at enhancing productivity by allowing users to manage their daily tasks. Built with React Native, it leverages local storage to save task data across sessions, ensuring data persistence.

Features
--------

- Add, delete, and toggle the completion status of tasks
- Form validation to prevent the submission of empty tasks
- Expanding and collapsing task views for a cleaner user interface
- Use of FlatList for efficient rendering and scrolling of a large list of tasks
- Responsive design for both Android and iOS

Installation
------------

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dderekk/TodoList.git

Usage
